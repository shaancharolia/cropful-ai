          CROPful is an AI model that allows farmers to input data like region,
          climate, crop type, and fertilizer use to receive an estimated crop
          yield for the upcoming year. This tool helps farmers experiment with
          different combinations of inputs, enabling them to make informed
          decisions and optimize their production for the next agricultural
          season.
